  The 2018 ASC/AGC Region II Student Competition</a> project is
  a 200,000 square-foot, 7-story, office building with
  a 3-story parking deck in the Southeastern United States.</p>
  <p>The project team has been asked to evaluate the risks associated with
  taking on this high-profile project. The team will be asked to identify
  and explain risks associated with the construction cycle – from pre-bid
  to post-construction – to ensure the protection of both the GC and the Owner.
  The team will be asked to address a gamut of concerns that include identifying
  risk, early negotiation concerns, and prioritizing concerns from a GC
  perspective, general conditions impacts, develop risk mitigation strategies,
  create means to track and quantify risk, and the ability to communicate those
  concerns to the entire project team.</p>
